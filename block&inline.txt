1)Block-Level Element
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

Ex:The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

     The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

2)Inline Element

An inline element does not start on a new line.

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

Ex:This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.
